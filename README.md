# representations-of-a-phylogenetic-tree
This package focus on realising the four representations out of five, described in the preprint arXiv:2011.11774, plus the conversions between them.

#The file titled "representations.py" contains the python code for the four representations of a phylogenetic tree, plus the conversions in between them. For more details see preprint arXiv:2011.11774v2. In this file after the defined functions, there are also examples on how to call the functions to use them, notated out. To execute the file, one can simply carry out "python representations.py" in the terminal window, after entering the folder where the file is located. Detailed explanation/instructions can be found inside the file.
